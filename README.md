# Welcome to Reminiz

This is a chatbot to help you see in real time which actors are on screen.

## Guidelines

For commit messages, we'll use the following standard https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message

## Getting Started

Set up ngrok to create a secure public URL, to be able to test your bot locally.
* Download and install ngrok here: [ngrok] (https://ngrok.com/)
* run ngrok in one of your terminal windows 
```
npm run ngrok
```
* Take the secure URL generated by ngrok, and set it up as the Bot's webhook on Facebook's developers platform


This project uses npm package manager. Run the following commands, in another terminal window, to start up the server locally

Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

```
npm install
```

Spin up the server locally.

```
npm start
```

You will also need to define the following variables in your .env file:

* MONGODB_URI
* PORT=5000
* PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN (facebook bot messenger access token)
* VERIFY_TOKEN (facebook bot messenger verification token)
* BING_ACCESS_KEY
* MOVIE_DB_ACCESS_KEY
* AMAZON_ID
* AMAZON_SECRET_KEY
* YOUTUBE_API_KEY
* SERVER_URI (the ngrok uri)
* DASHBOT_API_KEY (free analytics for messenger bots)

## Development / Production

Each Bot has only one Webhook, therefore only one Callback URL.
This is why there are two separate Bots:
* one for development, which has the the ngrok URL (App name: Reminiz-Test1, Page name: ReminizDev)
* one for production, which is hosted on Heroku (App name: Reminiz, Page name: Reminiz)
